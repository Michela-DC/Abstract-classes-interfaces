//      define a subclass Boat of Vehicle that has:
//         a double attribute maxKnotsSpeed
//         an int attribute boatKilosWeight
//         a mandatory override of the abstract method doVehicleSound() where you print the boat's sound
//         a constructor method that:
//               accepts 2 params (maxSpeed, weight)
//               assign the correct values to type, maxKnotsSpeed and boatKilosWeight
//               a method getBoatWeightAndSpeed that returns an informative String about the total kilos weight and the maximum knots speed
//     define a tester class where you:
//            create a Car object and a Boat object
//            invoke the two Vehicle methods for the newly created Car and Boat objects
//            print in console the Boat weight and speed using the dedicated method.
